# Web Design / Development

This is a starting guide for everyone trying to get into artificial intelligence. It helps me structure my personal learning path and will be updated as i progress. Hopefully, others can profit from it as well.

## Tools

Tools will be mentioned in the overview video but i would already start downloading this: [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Overview of Web Development:

## Programming

[theNewBoston - Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/user/thenewboston/featured): has tutorials on basically every programming language - however the channel is not active anymore so the "newest" versions might not be covered.
[https://www.youtube.com/user/TechGuyWeb - Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/user/TechGuyWeb): has a lot of tutorials specifically about web development.

- Basics:

Would definitely recommend programming along. If you mix JavaScript into HTML you can just run it in the browser. Otherwise i think the tutorials should mention a way on how to execute them.

  - start with HTML -> CSS -> JavaScript: HTML/CSS are the absolute basics. It resembles programming languages but it is not really programming. Still good to know but don't waste all of the time/motivation on it

## UI/UX Design

Not an expert but these are some channels i sometimes watch about design topics (only one for the moment :P):

- [theFutur - Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheSkoolRocks/videos): many videos about design in general but also about ui/ux: [here](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheSkoolRocks/search?query=ui)
